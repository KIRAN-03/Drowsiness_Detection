# Drowsiness_Detection

# Introduction
The Drowsiness Detection System is designed to monitor the driverâ€™s face through a camera in real-time and detect signs of drowsiness. If the driver shows signs of fatigue or sleepiness, the system triggers an alarm to alert the driver and prevent accidents.

The system uses computer vision and machine learning techniques to monitor eye movements and blinking patterns, making it an effective solution for real-time drowsiness detection.

# Features
